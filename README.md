## Project Overview
Customer segmentation allows businesses to target specific groups of customers more efficiently. This project uses unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means clustering to identify patterns in customer data and group them into segments. The segments can then be used for targeted marketing, personalized services, and other strategic purposes.

## Features
- Cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- Visualize clusters using various charts.
- Analyze customer demographics for better insights.
- Tailored recommendations for each customer segment.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for K-means clustering)

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about customers, including their purchase history, demographics, and spending patterns. The data is used to group customers into segments that share similar characteristics.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd customer-segmentation-retail
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values and normalizing the data.
2. Run the `customer_segmentation.py` script to apply K-means clustering.
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation.py
    ```
3. View the results in the output files, including visualizations of the customer segments.

## Results
The project identifies key customer segments based on purchasing patterns. Each segment can be analyzed for specific traits, enabling the business to optimize its marketing strategies.
